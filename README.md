# CISC472texttwist
This project was for my CISC472 Web Applications Security class. The application itself is functional, however, if I had the time I would have liked to format the page itself a little better to make it more user friendly. To begin the game simply click the 'start' button and when you've clicked the letter buttons for the word you want hit the 'check' button.
